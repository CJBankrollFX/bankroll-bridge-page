<!-- WHY SYSTEM SECTION -->
<section class="why-system">
  <h3>Why a System-Driven Approach Wins</h3>

  <div class="card-grid">

    <div class="card">
      <h4>More Freedom & Time Efficiency. Less Labour.</h4>
      <p>
        Active markets often require constant chart analysis and rapid decision-
        making. Manual execution can lead to delays, especially when work and daily
        responsibilities compete for attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system operates within predefined execution criteria during qualifying 
        market conditions, reducing reliance on continuous screen monitoring and 
        helping minimise missed setups caused by delayed reactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        This allows structured market participation without spending hours analysing 
        charts each day, while maintaining transparency and oversight.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>Emotional Relief & Controlled Risk</h4>
      <p>
        Risk Parameters Defined Before Emotion Enters
      </p>
      <p>
        Overtrading, impulsive entries and reactive decision-making are common 
        challenges in active markets. The system operates within client-approved 
        risk parameters, with position sizing and exposure limits configured in 
        advance. By defining risk boundaries before execution, participation becomes
        measured and controlled rather than emotionally driven - while you retain 
        authority over your account settings.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>Structure & Discipline</h4>
      <p>
        A Rules-Based Framework Designed for Consistency
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than relying on predictions or subjective market opinions, the system 
        functions within a structured, rules-based framework. Trade criteria must be 
        met before any execution occurs, reinforcing consistency in approach. This 
        promotes disciplined participation grounded in predefined methodology instead 
        of reactive market behaviour.

    <h2> Terms, Risk Disclosure & Privacy Policy</h2>

    <h3>Risk Disclosure</h3>
    <p>
      Trading financial markets, including leveraged derivative instruments, involves significant risk and may result in the loss of some or all invested capital. Market conditions can be volatile and unpredictable, and losses may occur rapidly.
      The system operates strictly within the Client’s pre-selected and pre-approved parameters. Execution occurs automatically according to predefined strategy logic and the risk settings elected by the Client. The Representative does not exercise discretionary authority over Client accounts and does not make independent investment decisions on behalf of the Client. 
      Market volatility, slippage, liquidity gaps, broker infrastructure, internet connectivity, VPS performance, and third-party platform failures may materially impact trade outcomes. No guarantees, promises, warranties, or representations of profit are made, whether express or implied. Past performance is not indicative of future results. 
      Participation is voluntary and based on the Client’s independent financial decision. The Client remains solely responsible for all account funding, leverage selection, margin management, risk parameter selection, and ongoing monitoring of their trading account. The Client should only trade with capital that they can afford to lose. 
      Electronic consent to these terms, including risk acknowledgment, is recorded and retained for compliance and evidentiary purposes.
    </p>

    <h3>Nature of Service</h3>
    <p>
      The system does not make independent investment decisions and does not exercise discretionary authority over Client accounts. It operates strictly in accordance with the Client’s pre-selected, predefined, and approved parameters and the underlying rule-based strategy framework. 
      The Representative does not alter, override, or modify trade logic outside of the Client’s elected settings. All execution occurs automatically within the boundaries of the Client-approved risk parameters. 
      The Client retains full control over account funding, leverage selection, broker selection, risk allocation, deposits, withdrawals, and the decision to activate, pause, or disconnect the system at any time.
    </p>

    <h3>Client Responsibility</h3>
    <p>
      The Client independently selects their risk tier, maintains sufficient margin, monitors account conditions, and remains solely responsible for all funding decisions, leverage configuration, and ongoing account supervision. 
      The Client acknowledges that participation is voluntary and based on their own financial assessment. The Client may pause or disconnect the system at any time and remains responsible for ensuring that their selected risk parameters remain appropriate for their financial circumstances.
    </p>

    <h3>No Custody of Funds</h3>
    <p>
      The Representative does not hold, control, custody, manage, transfer, process deposits, process withdrawals, or otherwise exercise authority over Client funds at any time. 
      All funds remain under the sole control of the Client and are held directly with the Client’s chosen brokerage provider. The Representative has no access to Client capital and cannot initiate withdrawals or transfer funds.
    </p>

    <h3>No Guarantee of Performance</h3>
    <p>
      The system does not guarantee profits, income, capital protection, or specific performance outcomes. Trading losses may occur, including partial or total loss of invested capital. 
      Any examples, historical illustrations, testimonials, or execution screenshots provided are for informational purposes only and do not constitute guarantees or representations of future results.
    </p>

    <h3>Conflict of Interest Disclosure</h3>
    <p>
      The Representative may act as an Introducing Broker to certain brokerage providers and may receive commission or referral-based remuneration arising from trading activity conducted by clients. 
      Such remuneration does not alter, influence, or override the predefined strategy logic or Client-elected parameters under which the system operates. 
      The Client acknowledges this potential conflict of interest and confirms that participation remains voluntary and based on independent decision-making.
    </p>

    <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Representative and/or Provider shall not be liable for:
      • Market losses, trading losses, or drawdowns
      • Broker execution delays, slippage, requotes, liquidity shortages or price discrepancies
      • Platform outages, VPS failure, internet disruptions or third-party infrastructure malfunction
      • Indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages
      • Loss of profit, loss of opportunity, or loss of data
      
      The Client acknowledges that trading involves inherent risk and that use of the system is entirely at the Client’s own risk.
      Nothing in this clause excludes liability arising from fraud, wilful misconduct, or gross negligence to the extent that such exclusion is prohibited by law.
    </p>

    <h3>Suspension Rights</h3>
    <p>
      The Provider reserves the right to suspend, restrict, or terminate system access where reasonably necessary, including but not limited to: 
      • Extreme market volatility 
      • Technical malfunction or infrastructure failure 
      • Regulatory or compliance requirements 
      • Breach of these Terms 
      • Suspected abuse, misuse, or unauthorised system replication 

      Suspension may occur with or without prior notice where reasonably required to protect system integrity, regulatory compliance, or operational stability.
    </p>

    <h3>System Usage</h3>
    <p>
      The system operates on one trading account per activated symbol. XAUUSD requires a dedicated trading account. NAS100 and US30 may operate on a shared trading account, subject to system compatibility and infrastructure requirements. 
      Where multiple symbols are activated simultaneously, separate VPS instances may be required. Each additional connected account may incur an additional monthly hosting and maintenance fee, as communicated at the time of activation. 
      The Monthly Access package includes one activated VPS account. The Lifetime Access package excludes ongoing hosting and maintenance fees, except where expressly stated (including any promotional free period). 
      For monthly subscribers, subscription fees are billed per calendar month from the date of activation. Failure to pay any subscription or hosting fee when due may result in immediate suspension of system access without notice. Access will be reinstated only upon receipt of payment. 
      The Provider reserves the right to perform maintenance, upgrades, or infrastructure modifications at any time. During such periods, the system may be temporarily unavailable. Maintenance or upgrade periods do not constitute a breach of service.
    </p>

    <h3>Lifetime Access Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
      Where a product is described as “Lifetime Access” or “Lifetime Licence,” such lifetime refers to the operational and commercial lifespan of the system while it remains actively maintained, supported, and legally permissible to operate. 
      Lifetime Access does not guarantee perpetual availability. 
      
      The Provider may modify, suspend, discontinue, or restructure the system where required due to: 
      • Regulatory or compliance changes 
      • Legislative amendments 
      • Market structural shifts 
      • Technological obsolescence 
      • Force majeure events 
      • Business restructuring or closure 
      
      Lifetime Access grants a usage licence only and does not constitute ownership, equity, or perpetual service guarantee.
    </p>

    <h3>Intellectual Property & Ownership</h3>
    <p>
      All rights, title, and interest in the system and all related materials, including but not limited to: 
      • Source code 
      • Strategy logic 
      • Algorithms 
      • Frameworks 
      • Documentation 
      • Branding and trade marks 
      
      remain the exclusive property of Clarence Williams / Bankroll FX. 
      
      The system is licensed, not sold. 
      Clients are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to use the system strictly in accordance with these Terms. 
      
      Clients may not: 
      • Copy, reproduce, or redistribute the system 
      • Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software 
      • Replicate or attempt to extract the strategy logic 
      • Resell, sublicense, or provide third-party access 
      • Circumvent technical protections 
      
      Any breach may result in immediate termination of access and legal enforcement, including injunctive relief where applicable.
    </p>

    <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
    <p>
      Due to the digital and infrastructure-based nature of the system, activation constitutes immediate commencement of service delivery. Upon activation, digital access credentials, configuration processes, and server resources are allocated. 
      Accordingly, once activation and configuration have commenced, fees are non-refundable. 
      No refunds shall be granted for: 
      • Trading losses or drawdowns 
      • Market volatility 
      • Dissatisfaction with performance 
      • Change of mind after activation 
      • Failure to utilise the system 
      • Suspension arising from breach of these Terms 
      
      Monthly subscriptions may be cancelled at any time prior to the next billing cycle. Cancellation prevents future charges but does not entitle the Client to a refund for the active billing period. 
      
      Nothing in this clause limits any mandatory rights afforded under applicable consumer protection legislation.
    </p>

    <h3>Chargeback Protection Clause</h3>
    <p>
      The Client agrees not to initiate payment reversals, chargebacks, or payment disputes in respect of valid transactions where services have been activated or made available. 
      Where a chargeback is initiated in breach of this clause: 
      • System access may be suspended immediately 
      • Outstanding amounts may become immediately due and payable 
      • The Provider reserves the right to recover legal costs, administrative costs, and collection fees incurred in recovering the disputed amount 
      This clause does not restrict lawful consumer rights but applies to invalid or abusive chargebacks.
    </p>

    <h3>Privacy & Data Protection & POPIA Compliance</h3>
    <p>
      The Client acknowledges and consents to the collection and processing of personal information, including name, contact details, and relevant brokerage information, for purposes including: 
      • Rendering of the services 
      • System activation and configuration 
      • Communication related to service delivery 
      • Regulatory compliance under FAIS and related legislation 
      • Record retention obligations 
      • Optional marketing communications (which may be withdrawn at any time) 
      
      Personal information will be processed lawfully and stored securely with appropriate technical and organisational safeguards. 
      
      Information will not be sold to third parties and will only be disclosed: 
      • Where required by law or regulatory authority 
      • Where necessary for execution through the selected brokerage provider 
      • Where required for compliance oversight by the FSP 
      
      Records will be retained for a minimum of five (5) years in accordance with applicable legislation. 
      
      Clients may request access to, correction of, or deletion of personal information subject to statutory retention obligations.
    </p>
