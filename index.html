<section class="why-system">
  <h3>Why a System-Driven Approach Wins</h3>

  <div class="card-grid">

    <div class="card">
      <h4>More Freedom. Less Labour.</h4>
      <p>
        The system analyses market conditions using a rule-based approach derived from prior 
        market research and chart analysis, an experience-driven strategy across US30, NAS100, 
        and Gold (XAUUSD). It is not a guarantee of specific results. It handles execution logic, 
        entries, exits, risk management, and trade structure with the involvement of a human 
        oversight - allowing participation without constant manual analysis and screen time 
        interrupting your day-to-day hours.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>High-Precision Setups With Controlled Execution</h4>
      <p>
        The system focuses exclusively on high-quality, high-probability setups during
        active market conditions. Trades are designed as efficient scalp opportunities,
        typically ranging between 1 to 30 minutes, with pre-defined client approved risk 
        management with trade opportunities executing real time entries and exits to save 
        you time and PT.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>Never Miss a Setup Again</h4>
      <p>
        Busy schedules and proper entry struggles no longer mean missed opportunities. 
        The system continuously monitors the market and executes according to its ruleset,
        ensuring opportunities are acted on even when you’re unavailable, with automatic 
        risk applied according to your specified appetite.

    <h2> Terms, Risk Disclosure & Privacy Policy</h2>

    <h3>Risk Disclosure</h3>
    <p>
      Trading financial markets involves significant risk and may result in the loss of some or all capital. The system applies your pre-defined consent-given rules and executes trades accordingly. Market volatility, slippage, liquidity gaps, and broker infrastructure may impact results. No guarantees, promises, or representations of profit are made, expressed, or implied. Past performance is not indicative of future results. We do not guarantee uninterrupted operation and are not liable for third party infrastructure failures. Participation is voluntarily and based on your independent financial decision. You are solely responsible for all investments into your account, risk-peramters and trading decisions. You should only trade with capital that you can afford to lose.
    </p>

    <h3>Nature of Service</h3>
    <p>
      The service consists of intermediary execution of derivative trades via a rule-based system operating with direct involvement of a natural person and constant human supervision.
      This service does not constitute portfolio management or discretionary investment management whatsoever. The service provider has no access to the clients funds nor can any outcome be made at the sole discretion of the service provider. All decisions are client-based.
    </p>

    <h3>Client Responsibility</h3>
    <p>
      The client selects their own risk tier, maintains sufficient margin, retains full control over account funding and withdrawals, and may pause or disconnect the system at any time.
    </p>

    <h3>No Custody of Funds</h3>
    <p>
      The Representative does not hold client funds, process withdrawals, process deposits, or exercise any authority over client capital.
    </p>

    <h3>No Guarantee of Performance</h3>
    <p>
      The system does not guarantee profits, income, or capital protection. Trading losses may occur.
    </p>

    <h3>Conflict of Interest Disclosure</h3>
    <p>
      The Representative may act as an Introducing Broker and may receive commision from positive trading activity. Such compensation does not alter strategy execution.
    </p>

    <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>
      The Representative shall not be liable for Market losses, Broker execution issues, platform downtime, VPS or internet failure, Slippage, or indirect or consewuential damages. Nothing excludes liability arising from fraud, wilful misconduct or gross negligence.
    </p>

    <h3>Suspension Rights</h3>
    <p>
      Execution may be suspended due to extreme volatility, technical malfunction, compliance or regulatory instruction.
    </p>

    <h3>System Usage</h3>
    <p>
      The system operates on one trading account per active symbol. XAUUSD requires one trading account. NAS100 and US30 can share one trading account. Running multiple symbols simultaneously requires seperate VPS accounts. Each additional connected account incurs an additional R187 monthly hosting and maintenance fee. The monthly package includes one VPS activated account. The lifetime package excludes the maintenance and server fee (1 Free month on us), and users will receive a Yoco Payment request every calendar month to renew their server and maintenance fees, or monthly subscription fees for monthly subscribers. If a server fee, or monthly subscription fee is missed, the user loses their rights to utilise the system immediately, and will automatically lose access to the system until payment is received. The system may undergo maintenance or performance upgrades at any given time, leaving the system offline until completed. A monthly subscriber means they have a full calendar month access of online system use, which excludes upgrades and maintenance periods.
    </p>

    <h3>Lifetime Access Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
      Where a product is described as "lifetime access" or "lifetime licence", such lifetime shall refer to:
      The operational lifetime of the product, and the period during which the system remains commercially active and supported by the Provider.
      Lifetime Access does not guarantee perpetual operation in the event of Regulatory changes, compliance directives, market structural changes, business closure, force majeure events, technological obsolescence. The provider reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the system where required for regulatory, operational, or compliance reasons.
    </p>
