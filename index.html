  <h3>Why a System-Driven Approach Wins</h3>

  <div class="card-grid">

    <div class="card">
      <h4>More Freedom. Less Labour.</h4>
      <p>
        The system analyses market conditions using a proven, experience-driven strategy
        across US30, NAS100, and Gold (XAUUSD). It handles execution logic, entries, exits,
        risk management, and trade structure - allowing participation without constant
        manual analysis and screen time interrupting your day-to-day hours.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>High-Precision Setups With Controlled Execution</h4>
      <p>
        The system focuses exclusively on high-quality, high-probability setups during
        active market conditions. Trades are designed as efficient scalp opportunities,
        typically ranging between 1 to 30 minutes, with automatic risk management with
        trade opportunities executing real time entries and exits to save you time and PT.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>Never Miss a Setup Again</h4>
      <p>
        Busy schedules and proper entry struggles no longer mean missed opportunities. 
        The system continuously monitors the market and executes according to its ruleset,
        ensuring opportunities are acted on even when you’re unavailable, with automatic 
        risk applied according to your specified appetite.

    <h2> Terms, Risk Disclosure & Privacy Policy</h2>

    <h3>Educational Use Only</h3>
    <p>
      All tools, systems, and materials provided are for educational and informational purposes only and do
      not constitute financial, investment, or trading advice. We do not offer account management or
      personalised financial recommendations. By utilise our systems and tools, you agree to do so at your own risk.
    </p>

    <h3>Risk Disclosure</h3>
    <p>
      Trading financial markets involves significant risk and may result in losses. You are solely responsible for all investments into your account and trades. You should only trade with capital that you can afford to lose. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
    </p>

    <h3>System Usage</h3>
    <p>
      The system operates on one trading account per active symbol. Running multiple symbols simultaneously requires seperate trading accounts. Each additional connected account incurs an additional R187 monthly hosting and maintenance fee. The lifetime package excludes the maintenance and server fee, and users will receive a Yoco Payment request every calendar month to renew their server and maintenance fees, or monthly subscription fees for monthly subscribers. If a server fee, or monthly subscription fee is missed, the user loses their rights to utilise the system immediately, and will automatically lose access to the system until payment is received. The system may undergo maintenance or performance upgrades at any given time, leaving the system offline until completed. A monthly subscriber means they have a full calendar month access of online system use, which excludes upgrades and maintenance periods.
    </p>

    <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
    <p>
      Due to the digital nature of our tools, systems and services, all purchases are final. No refunds are offered.
    </p>

    <h3>Privacy & Data Protection</h3>
    <p>
      Your personal information is used strictly for account setup, communication, support and occasional marketing (which you may opt out of at any given time).
      We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.
