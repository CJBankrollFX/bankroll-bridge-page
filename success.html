    For Lifetime purchases, to ensure continuous performance, and ongoing system updates,
    a small monthly hosting fee applies of R187/Month per activated account. <strong>First Month of hosting on us.</strong>


    For Monthly subscribers, your monthly hosting fees are included in your subscription. You will receive
    an automated YOCO Payment request every calendar month to optionally renew your subscription - If a payment is
    not received, access will be revoked until payment is received, to which access will be granted again immediately.
    This applies for hosting fees for the Lifetime Package as well.
